# ODK Central API (JSON) false-positive mitigation
#
# Some authenticated Central web UI operations (e.g. PATCH) can accumulate CRS
# anomaly score >= default threshold and be blocked by rule 949110.
#
# Prevent CRS from blocking Central API requests based on the aggregate anomaly
# score threshold (rule 949110). This keeps detections/logging from individual
# rules, but avoids disruptive 403s during normal UI operations.
